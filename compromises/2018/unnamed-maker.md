# Unnamed Maker

Attackers compromised a font package installed by a PDF editor application 
and used it to deploy a cryptocurrency miner on users' computers.
Since the PDF editor was installed under SYSTEM privileges, 
the malicious coinminer code hidden inside the font package 
would receive full access to the victims' system.


## Effect

Users who have installed this PDF editor between January and March 2018 have been affected.

## Attacker Type of Access

This was a counterfeit artifact delivered to developers.
