# Monju Incident

The attackers subverted a legitimate software server (GOM Player website) 
and delivered a malicious version of the application to users. 
Upon connecting to the application website to update the installed software, 
users were redirected to a different website, controlled by the attackers.
Thus, the users received a modified version of the software bundled with a Trojan.

## Impact

N/A

## Type of Compromise

Attackers could have access to  infrastructure,
but not to developer keys.
